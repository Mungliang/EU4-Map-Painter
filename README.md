# EU4-Map-Painter
EU4 history files editor. Just a few clicks on the map, and boom: you painted your own start.

As of 1.0, the program just works and nothing else. You can use it to change history files without much effort, but it is not dynamic, nor it is very intuitive in the first moment.
These questions are to be solved with newer versions.
